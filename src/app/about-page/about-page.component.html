        <p>
          When I first began app development, my goal was simple: build apps and publish them to both the 
          App Store (iOS) and the Play Store (Android). I was excited when my first Flutter app was nearly ready, 
          and I started the process of applying for developer accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, everything seemed fine — my Google Play Console account got approved. I was thrilled to be 
          part of the developer community and ready to share my creations with the world.

          The Incident
        </mat-card-title>
      </mat-card-header>
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>
          Around that time, I got a customer from an online platform who wanted to use my Play Store account 
          to publish their apps. I knew the Play Store's policies well: if you let other developers publish 
          through your account, you must ensure they're authentic and compliant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, this person tried to publish non-allowed apps using my account. Soon after, I received 
          an email from the Play Store support team — my apps were removed, and my account was permanently suspended.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight-text">
          I appealed many times, but every request was rejected. The account was gone for good.

          The Turning Point

      </mat-card-header>
      <mat-card-content>
        <p class="emphasis-text">
          That was the turning point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of letting this setback stop me, I decided: <strong>Why not build my own app store?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A place where I could directly share my apps with people — without unnecessary restrictions.
        </p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <mat-icon class="highlight-icon">stars</mat-icon>
          <p><strong>That's how Solidev Store was born.</strong></p>
        </div>
        <p>
          At first, it was just a web app, where users could download my apps directly. Later, I realized — 
          a web app isn't enough. To make it easier for users, I built an Android app for Solidev Store, 
          allowing people to browse and install apps right from their phones.

          And this is just the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I'm working on the next big step: a <strong>Developer Console</strong> that will let other 
          developers build and publish their valid, authentic apps to Solidev Store. This way, Solidev won't 
          just be my store — it'll be a community-driven platform for developers who want to reach users directly.
